# What is PreProcessing?

PreProcessing covers

- 📝 **Creation** - focus on the creation of solid modeling of the geometry
- 🎨 **Loading** - load CAD geometry
- 🎨 **Reparing** - prepare CAD geometry for meshing
- 🧑‍💻 **Meshing** - creates mesh for the geometry
<br>
<br>

This is the starting point for the classical pipeline

These operations may be

- difficult (up to several months to get a descent mesh)
- time and ressources consuming 
- meshing higly depends on chosen numerical models
