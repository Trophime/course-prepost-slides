= The case

see link:https://docs.feelpp.org/toolboxes/latest/thermoelectric/electromagnet/index.html[feelpp toolbox thermo-electric cases]

== Data files

=== Inspect the mesh with gmsh

The mesh can be retrieve from girder with the following ID: 5af59e88b0e9574027047fc0 (see xref:contribute:girder:index.adoc[girder]).

== Running the case

The command line to run this case in linear is

[[command-line-linear]]
[source,mpirun]
----
mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_thermoelectric --case "github:{path:toolboxes/thermoelectric/cases/ElectroMagnets/HL-31_H1}"
----

The command line to run this case in non linear is

[[command-line-nonlinear]]
[source,mpirun]
----
mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_thermoelectric --case "github:{path:toolboxes/thermoelectric/cases/ElectroMagnets/HL-31_H1}" --case.config-file HL-31_H1_nonlinear.cfg
----

== Viewing the results

The results are stored in `/home/feelpp/feelppdb/toolboxes/fsi/movingboundary/np_4`
if you run the simulation in the devcontainer. If not, check the output of of the command to 
get the name of the basedir of the results.

To view the results, you can either run paraview or use some pyvista scripts (see notes on jupyter)
